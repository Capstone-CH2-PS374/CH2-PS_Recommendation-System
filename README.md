Developing a recommendation system using TensorFlow to personalize volunteering opportunities to users skills, interests, backgrounds, and locations. We used open-source software to integrate the volunteer match dataset, then applied TF preprocessing methods like tokenizer, embeddings, and data pipeline to serve the model.
